# Introduction

This is a 5 day project for Microverse, in this time I have had to learn how to use the Phaser 3 framework, create the story, find the different assets, test the game and meet all the given requirements.

# Story

In a galaxy far, far away, a civil war is brewing. The Rebels have infiltrated the highest spheres of the Galactic Democratic Government to take power and thus be able to dominate the galaxy under their orders.
The Rebels, after their first battle won, have managed to kidnap Princess Dung, who guarded important information to end the rebels and thus also the war.
The Galactic Democratic Government, seeing that its supremacy is in jeopardy, decide to send its best pilot, Captain Tintin, on a rescue mission ...

- Phase 2: Choose the story to develop and planning how the code would be structured.
- Phase 3: Starting to code basic classes to develop the game.
- Phase 4: Fix issues
- Phase 5: Add extra features(score, lifes, multiple stages....).
- Phase 6: Testing the gameplay.
- Phase 7: Select and add all the assets to the game.
- Phase 8: Deployment.
